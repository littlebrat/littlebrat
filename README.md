## 🚀 Side Projects

### Hexapod | [Video](http://youtu.be/Opzd3Esc2lg)
Led a team of 10 to build a Hexapod robot from scratch, with an active role in software and hardware design. Used an Arduino and Raspberry Pi to control its 18 independent joints. This project won a 3D printer at Lisbon Maker Faire.

### SocRob Robotics Team
Competed in RoboCup 2016 and European Robotics League 2016. I was in charge of a robotic arm for manipulation tasks, configured with ROS and MoveIt planner.

### A Differential Drive Robot | [Video](https://youtu.be/SjuJ2os2flo)
Designed and built an autonomous robot during high school that follows lines and avoids obstacles.

### Heavy Machinery Part Browser 
Created an interactive web app for procuring heavy machinery parts, measurements, and compatibility.
