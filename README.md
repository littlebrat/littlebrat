# Hello, World! 👋 

I'm Nuno (not a nickname 😛), a passionate and diligent software engineer. I currently work at CERN as a Full Stack Developer where I'm part of a great team that develops software for Particle Accelator Hardware 🚀 

This is my team: https://epc-ccs.web.cern.ch/content/tools

## 🚀 Side Projects/Activities

_Disclaimer: None of these activities were part of my University curriculi or my current job._

### 🏭 Assessing China's Heavy Machinery Factories: 
I traveled across China, visiting over 40 factories that produce heavy machinery parts. My aim was to evaluate their manufacturing processes, quality control, and operational efficiency. This allowed me to gain detailed insights into their production methods, compliance with safety and quality standards, and the reliability of their products in the heavy machinery sector.

### 🕵️ Heavy Machinery Part Browser
Created an interactive web app for procuring heavy machinery parts, measurements and compatibility.

### 🕷️ Hexapod | [Video](http://youtu.be/Opzd3Esc2lg)
Led a team of 10 to build a Hexapod robot from scratch, with an active role in software and hardware design. Used an Arduino and Raspberry Pi to control its 18 independent joints. This project won a 3D printer at Lisbon Maker Faire.

### 🤖 SocRob Robotics Team
Competed in RoboCup 2016 and European Robotics League 2016. I was in charge of a robotic arm for manipulation tasks, configured with ROS and MoveIt planner.

### 🚙 A Differential Drive Robot | [Video](https://youtu.be/SjuJ2os2flo)
Designed and built an autonomous robot during high school that follows lines and avoids obstacles.
