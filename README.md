### 🕵️ Heavy Machinery Part Browser
Created an interactive web app for procuring heavy machinery parts, measurements and compatibility.
As part of this project I traveled across China, visiting over 40 factories that produce heavy machinery parts. My aim was to evaluate their manufacturing processes, quality control, and operational efficiency. This allowed me to gain detailed insights into their production methods, compliance with safety and quality standards, and the reliability of their products in the heavy machinery sector.
